import csv

# Creating script to tranform the transcripts to appropriate form for other paper 
# TODO:
# 1. Query all files with .csv endings 
# 2. Read the files line by line, lump preceeding stutters into one, ignore stutters with label 'i' [removing interjection]
# 3. Write to a .txt file in the format 'label start_time end_time', 
#    name of text file should be the same as the cvs maybe relocate it
